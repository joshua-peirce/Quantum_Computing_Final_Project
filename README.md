Walkthrough of physical simulation using a quantum computer.

This paper demonstrates how one can simulate a quantum harmonic oscillator on a quantum computer.
A model is built of the quantum circuit on a classical computer and demonstrates that it works and gives
some loose figures of accuracy. It simulates a quantum harmonic oscillator for half an oscillation, and
achieve 99.9% overlap with the optimal wave function in the span of the computational basis. Lastly,
some of the advantages and limitations of using quantum computing technologies to simulate physical
systems in the future are discussed.
